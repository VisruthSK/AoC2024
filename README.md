# AoC 2024

AOC 2024, solutions in R. I got busy and will probably come back to these problems in the future. I wrote the posted solutions as fast as possible as opposed to being as elegant as possible. I mixed Tidyverse, Base R, etc. and wrote whatever I was feeling like at the moment. Upon revist, I will definitely rewrite for elegance.

Please note that my puzzle inputs are in a (separate) private repo; to run these solutions, you would need to provide your own data in a similar format. My inputs are all at the root dir of my repo and are titled '##.txt'. I split question 5 into 05a.txt and 05b.txt to make reading the data easier.
